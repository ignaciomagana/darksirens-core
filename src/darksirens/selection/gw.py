Hierarchical selection integral for gravitational-wave population inference.

Physical picture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The observed GW event rate depends on which signals pass the detection
threshold.  To avoid biasing the population inference, we must correct
for this selection effect via Thrane & Talbot (2019) / Farr (2019):

    log L_sel = -N_obs * log μ  +  N_obs(N_obs + 3) / (2 N_eff)

where μ is the expected number of detections per unit time under the
proposed population model, estimated as a Monte Carlo average over
injection samples:

    μ = (1/N_draw) Σ_{det inj}  p_pop(d_i|λ) / p_draw(d_i)

and N_eff is the effective sample size of the selection integral
(Farr 2019, arXiv:1904.10879, eq. 15):

    N_eff = μ² / Var(μ)   ≈   [Σ w_i]² / Σ w_i²

The coefficient N_obs(N_obs+3)/(2 N_eff) is the leading-order correction
from the uncertainty in μ on the log-likelihood (Farr 2019, eq. 11).
The "+3" is a PRIOR CONVENTION on μ, not a higher-order Taylor term —
see the derivation below, and ``tests/test_selection_correction_coefficient.py``
which pins it numerically.

Derivation.  Marginalising the rate R out of the Poisson likelihood with
the scale-free prior p(R) ∝ 1/R leaves L ∝ μ^{-N}.  Monte-Carlo error
makes μ itself uncertain: μ ~ N(μ̂, σ²) with σ = μ̂/√N_eff.  Marginalising
that uncertainty under a scale-invariant prior p(μ) ∝ 1/μ,

    ⟨μ^{-N}⟩ / μ̂^{-N} = ⟨μ^{-N-1}⟩_G / ⟨μ^{-1}⟩_G
                       = [1 + (N+1)(N+2)/(2 N_eff)] / [1 + 2/(2 N_eff)]
                       = 1 + [(N+1)(N+2) − 2] / (2 N_eff)
                       = 1 + N(N+3) / (2 N_eff),

using ⟨μ^{-k}⟩_G/μ̂^{-k} ≈ 1 + k(k+1)σ²/(2μ̂²) for a Gaussian.  A FLAT
prior on μ would instead give N(N+1)/(2 N_eff); the two differ at O(1/N)
and the N(N+3) form is the one Farr (2019) states and that the reference
implementation uses (``gwpopulation.vt.ResamplingVT.vt_factor``:
``vt_factor = mu / exp((3 + n_events) / (2 n_effective))``, whose
``-N log vt_factor`` is exactly the expression above).  The N_obs²/(2 N_eff)
form sometimes quoted is the leading term only.

CAUTION: gwpopulation deprecates this marginalisation ("we recommend not
to use this as it is not completely understood if this uncertainty
marginalization is correct") in favour of bounding the variance of the
TOTAL log-likelihood — which is exactly the criterion this module already
enforces as its primary guard (next section).  The correction below is
kept because it is the community-standard closed form and is O(1/N_eff)
inside the region the guard admits, but the guard, not the correction, is
what protects the inference.

Reliability criterion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Farr (2019) recommends discarding proposals where N_eff < 4 N_obs
(equivalently returning -inf); Vitale et al. (2022) use 5 N_obs.  Both
control the MEAN correction only.  The state-of-the-art criterion
(Essick & Farr 2022; Talbot & Golomb 2023; adopted by the GWTC-4.0 and
GWTC-5.0 population analyses) instead bounds the Monte-Carlo variance of
the TOTAL log-likelihood estimator,

    σ²_lnL = Σ_i σ²_i  +  N_obs² σ²_sel  <=  max_likelihood_variance

where σ²_i = Σ_j w_ij²/(Σ_j w_ij)² − 1/n_i is the per-event variance from
reweighting n_i PE samples (``log_evidence_and_mc_variance``) and
σ²_sel = Var[log μ] = 1/N_eff is the selection variance (this module's
N_eff = μ²/Var(μ) already contains the −1/N_draw term, so N_obs²/N_eff
is exactly the N_obs² σ²_sel component).  The likelihood carries
``-N_obs log mu``, so selection noise enters amplified by N_obs;
controlling it needs ``N_eff >> N_obs^2``, strictly stronger than
5 N_obs once N_obs > 5.  We therefore guard on

    N_eff > max(5 N_obs, N_obs² / (max_likelihood_variance − Σ_i σ²_i))

with ``max_likelihood_variance = 1`` by default (σ(lnL) <= 1 nat, the
GWTC-4.0/5.0 threshold), keeping the Vitale mean floor.  With
``Σ_i σ²_i = 0`` this reduces exactly to the selection-only variance
criterion ``N_eff > N_obs² / max_likelihood_variance``.

    Reverse-mode discipline
    -----------------------
    The variance is carried as the INVERSE effective sample size

        1/N_eff = Var(μ̂)/μ̂² = exp(lse2 - 2·lse) - 1/Ndraw,

    the stable direct form :func:`log_evidence_and_mc_variance` already uses,
    NOT as ``logdiffexp(log_s2, 2·log_mu - log_Ndraw)``.  Uniform (or
    numerically uniform) importance weights make those two logdiffexp operands
    EQUAL: the forward value is correctly -inf, but the derivative runs through
    ``log1p(-exp(0))``, whose slope is 1/0, and reverse-mode AD has already
    evaluated that branch by the time a downstream ``jnp.where`` selects the
    other one — a ``where`` cannot erase a NaN cotangent.  MEASURED on master:
    four equal log weights gave the correct statistics (0, inf, -inf) with an
    all-NaN Jacobian, and ``selection_log_correction`` returned 0.0 with
    gradient [nan, nan, nan, nan].  A perfectly valid deterministic selection
    campaign therefore produced a finite log likelihood and unusable gradients
    for NUTS/HMC and every gradient optimizer.

    Both operands of every ``jnp.where`` below are finite, so the dead branch
    contributes a ZERO cotangent rather than a NaN one (the same discipline as
    ``redshift/catalog.py:_logsumexp_neginf_safe``).

    Log selection correction term (Farr 2019 / Talbot & Golomb 2023).

    Returns ``-inf`` when the Monte-Carlo estimate of the log-likelihood
    is too noisy to trust, under BOTH criteria:

    * ``N_eff <= 5 N_obs`` — the Vitale et al. (2022) floor on the MEAN
      correction;
    * ``σ²_lnL = pe_variance_sum + N_obs²/N_eff > max_likelihood_variance``
      — the GWTC-4.0/5.0 bound on the VARIANCE of the TOTAL log-likelihood
      estimator (Essick & Farr 2022; Talbot & Golomb 2023).
      ``pe_variance_sum`` is Σ_i σ²_i over the per-event reweighting
      variances (``log_evidence_and_mc_variance``); ``N_obs²/N_eff`` is
      the selection component: the likelihood carries ``-N_obs log mu``,
      so a Monte-Carlo fluctuation ``sigma(log mu) ~ 1/sqrt(N_eff)``
      enters amplified by N_obs.  The 5 N_obs floor alone does NOT
      control this at larger catalogs: at N_obs = 50 it admits
      N_eff ~ 300, where an ordinary ~3.5 sigma dip in log mu across a
      parameter grid (0.19 nats at N_eff ~ 350) becomes an e^{9.5}
      likelihood spike — measured in end-to-end mock closures, where such
      spikes carried 30-86% of the posterior mass in a single grid cell
      and reproduced at the same parameter values across independent
      event realizations sharing an injection set.  The default
      ``max_likelihood_variance = 1.0`` caps sigma(lnL) at 1 nat, the
      threshold adopted by the GWTC-4.0/5.0 population analyses.  With
      ``pe_variance_sum = 0`` (the default) the criterion reduces exactly
      to the selection-only bound ``N_eff > N_obs²/max_likelihood_variance``.

    With ``soft_guard=True`` (gradient-based samplers) the hard wall is
    replaced by a steep smooth penalty — see the inline comment.  The
    wall stays keyed on ``Neff/threshold``; the per-event variances enter
    through the threshold, so it engages smoothly as the budget is spent.
    Once ``pe_variance_sum`` exceeds the budget the threshold saturates at
    ``N_obs²/1e-12`` (its gradient w.r.t. ``pe_variance_sum`` clamps to
    zero there) and the wall repels through the ``Neff``/``log_mu``
    channels at its validated full depth.

    The correction is:

        -N_obs * log μ  +  N_obs * (N_obs + 3) / (2 * N_eff)

    The first term is the standard Poisson selection factor.  The second is
    the leading Monte-Carlo uncertainty correction of Farr (2019) eq. 11,
    matching ``gwpopulation.vt.ResamplingVT.vt_factor``.  The ``+3`` follows
    from marginalising μ under a scale-invariant p(μ) ∝ 1/μ — a flat prior
    would give N_obs(N_obs+1) instead — NOT from a higher-order Taylor term;
    the module docstring carries the derivation and
    ``tests/test_selection_correction_coefficient.py`` pins it numerically.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_mu : log of the selection integral estimate
    Neff   : effective sample size of the selection integral
    nEvents : number of observed GW events
    max_likelihood_variance : cap on the variance of the total
        log-likelihood estimator, ``pe_variance_sum + N_obs²/N_eff``.
    pe_variance_sum : Σ_i σ²_i, the summed per-event Monte-Carlo
        variances of ``ln Ẑ_i`` (traced scalar or 0.0).  CAUTION: the
        total-variance criterion is only enforced when the caller threads
        this in; at the 0.0 default the guard silently reverts to the
        selection-only bound.  Both the standard core and the
        cluster/lensing stack (per-event, lensed-singleton, and per-pair
        variances) thread it.

    Estimate log μ, N_eff and log_sigma2 from the injection set.

    Returns the 3-tuple ``(log_mu, Neff, log_sigma2)`` (the third element is the
    log Monte-Carlo variance of μ, used by the strong-lensing cluster path; the
    standard single-event likelihood ignores it).

    Parameters
    ----------
    gw_sel : GWEvent
        Injection samples (detected).  If ``sel_batch_size`` is set and the
        length is not divisible by the batch size, the event is padded with
        explicit invalid sentinel rows before scanning.
    em_catalog_sel : Any
        EM catalog sliced to the injection sky positions.
    log_weight_fn : callable(m1det, q, dL, chieff, pix, prior_wt, catalog) → array
        When ``gw_sel.spin`` is not None the callable is instead invoked with a
        trailing ``spin=(batch, d)`` keyword; chi_eff-basis weight functions
        (and test doubles) never see it.
        Per-sample log importance weight.  Must broadcast over the batch
        dimension.  Typically a closure from ``likelihood.py`` that captures
        cosmo, survey, pop_params, and the finite-guard for log_prior_z.
    Ndraw : float
        Total number of generated injections (detected + missed).
    nEvents : int
        Number of observed GW events.  ACCEPTED BUT UNUSED here (kept for the
        call-signature compatibility of every existing caller): the N_eff
        reliability check lives in :func:`selection_log_correction`, which the
        caller invokes with these outputs.  Estimating ``log_mu`` does not apply
        any guard -- passing ``nEvents`` here does NOT protect a caller that
        skips :func:`selection_log_correction`.
    sel_batch_size : int or None
        If not None, process injections in chunks via ``lax.scan`` to
        limit peak GPU memory.  Non-divisible inputs are padded internally;
        padded rows have ``valid == False`` and contribute zero weight.
    sky_log_weight_fn : callable(nx, ny, nz, dL) → array or None
        Optional sky factor ``log g(n̂, z)`` added to each injection's log
        importance weight (the same factor applied to the PE term), so the
        selection integral reweights ``μ`` consistently.  ``dL`` is passed so the
        closure can derive the redshift ``z`` for 3-D ``g(n̂, z)`` models with the
        same cosmology as the PE term.  ``None`` (default) leaves the integral
        sky-agnostic — the isotropic / legacy behaviour.

    Returns
    -------
    log_mu : scalar — log of the selection integral estimate
    Neff   : scalar — effective sample size
    log_sigma2 : scalar — log Monte-Carlo variance of μ (used by the
        strong-lensing cluster path; ignored by the standard likelihood)
