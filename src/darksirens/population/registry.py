registry.py
-----------
Population model registry for gravitational-wave source inference.

The model NAME is the model definition.  ``--pop_model`` strings are parsed by
:mod:`darksirens.population.grammar`::

    powerlaw+peak                       PowerLaw + Gaussian peak mixture
    brokenpowerlaw+2peaks+powerlaw      BPL + 2 Gaussians + PL tail
    3powerlaws+peak                     novel composition - works with NO code

Sharing of beta/pairing, spin, and gamma is controlled by separate
``shared_beta``, ``shared_spin``, and ``shared_gamma`` flags, not by suffixes
in the model name.

Components self-register grammar tokens with default labels, prior bounds, and
fiducials (see :mod:`.components`).  Curated legacy compositions keep their
physics-tuned per-slot priors and fiducial weights through the pure-data
``CURATED`` table below.  Anything else builds from blueprint defaults (an
``logging.info`` notes this).

Adding a model
--------------
* New combination of existing components: just use the name - nothing to add.
* Tuned priors/fiducials for a composition: add ONE ``Curated`` entry.
* New mass component type: decorate the class with ``@mass_token`` in
  parametric.py (or register a blueprint in components.py for lazy classes).
* Non-mixture model: decorate a factory with ``@register_model`` below.

Stick-breaking weight parameterisation
--------------------------------------
Sampled weight parameters are stick-breaking inputs ``$v_i$`` in [0, 1].
``Curated.weights`` stores DESIRED FINAL FRACTIONS (human-readable; the last
fraction is implied); ``build_fiducial_vector`` converts them via ``_w_to_v``.

Legacy names (pre-grammar registry)
-----------------------------------
``twopowerlaws+*`` spellings and the long GWTC-5 names resolve through
``LEGACY_BASE_ALIASES`` / ``LEGACY_NAME_ALIASES`` with a DeprecationWarning,
so old settings.json files and HDF5 ``pop_model`` attrs keep working.

# ── the curated fiducials that violate their own overridden priors ────────────
#
# Three curated entries inherit the component blueprints' DEFAULT fiducials
# (powerlaw m_max = 80, m_min = 5; peak mu = 35) while overriding the priors to
# split a low-mass and a high-mass power law and to push the peak above 50.
# MEASURED violations (``get_fixed_population_params``, warn path):
#
#   2powerlaws+peak    PL1.m_max 80 vs [15, 50]; PL2.m_min 5 vs [20, 40];
#                      G.mu 35 vs [50, 100]
#   2powerlaws+2peaks  PL1.m_max 80 vs [15, 50]; PL2.m_min 5 vs [20, 40]
#   2powerlaws+3peaks  PL1.m_max 80 vs [15, 50]; PL2.m_min 5 vs [20, 40]
#
# A ``--fix_population`` run does not apply the sampling prior, so an
# out-of-prior fiducial is not by itself an invalid density.  It becomes a
# defect the moment the fixed arm is read as NESTED IN, or directly comparable
# to, the sampled model: the sampled model cannot represent its own fiducial,
# so no amount of data moves the posterior onto it and every arm-to-arm shift
# is contaminated by that gap.
#
# The corrected set below is chosen by ONE mechanical rule -- the MIDPOINT of
# the overridden prior for each violating parameter -- so it is reproducible
# and carries no new tuning.  It leaves the composition's intent intact: PL1
# becomes the low-mass continuum [5, 32.5], PL2 the high-mass one [30, 80], and
# the peak sits at 75 where its own prior puts it.
