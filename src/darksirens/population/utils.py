@dataclass(frozen=True)
class NormalizationGridSettings:
    """Settings controlling GW-population normalisation quadrature grids.

    The mass, mass-ratio, and spin normalisations are evaluated on cached
    trapezoid grids.  Values can be configured with ``configure_normalization_grids``
    or the environment variables ``DARKSIRENS_GW_N_MASS``,
    ``DARKSIRENS_GW_N_Q``, and ``DARKSIRENS_GW_N_CHI``.

    ``pairing_m1_grid`` is an OPT-IN accuracy knob (default None = exact; env
    ``DARKSIRENS_GW_PAIRING_M1_GRID``, an int to enable, ``0`` or ``none`` to
    explicitly disable): when set to an int N the pairing model's
    per-sample q-normalisation is interpolated from an N-node static m1 grid
    instead of integrated exactly per sample (see ``get_pairing_m1_grid`` and
    ``PairingModel.__call__``).  Samples the interpolant cannot resolve -- those
    near the normaliser's SUPPORT EDGE, where I(m1) ~ eps exp(-dm/eps) has an
    essential singularity -- are not interpolated at all but integrated on their
    OWN support with the Gauss-Legendre rule below.

    ``pairing_edge_nq`` (env ``DARKSIRENS_GW_PAIRING_EDGE_NQ``) is the node count
    PER PANEL of that per-sample edge rule and ``pairing_edge_tol`` (env
    ``DARKSIRENS_GW_PAIRING_EDGE_TOL``) the interpolation-error budget, in nats,
    that decides which samples take it: a grid node is TRUSTED when the second
    difference of log I over 8 -- the linear-interpolation error bound on a
    uniform-in-log-m1 grid -- is within ``pairing_edge_tol`` and no zero-support
    node lies within one cell.  Since 2026-09-05 the edge rule is the SAME
    two-panel Gauss-Legendre split as the exact branch (see
    ``get_pairing_panel_quadrature`` and ``PairingModel._panel_norm``), just at
    ``pairing_edge_nq`` nodes per panel instead of ``PAIRING_PANEL_NQ``.  Measured
    over 50 (m_min, dm_min, beta) prior draws, worst |Delta log density| against a
    composite-Gauss-Legendre reference (256+32 sub-panels, self-converged to
    2e-16) in the 24 grid cells above the support edge: 22.6 nats with the
    pre-2026-08-28 fixed-q-grid clamp, 2.6e-3 with ``pairing_edge_nq = 24`` --
    against 7.6e-3 for the EXACT branch itself at 16 nodes per panel (3.1e-2
    for the 200-node uniform q-trapezoid the panel split replaced, which did not
    resolve the taper boundary layer at all).  Those two figures were recorded
    when ``PAIRING_PANEL_NQ`` was 16; on 2026-09-06 it became 32 and this
    default moved 24 -> 48 with it, keeping the same 1.5x ratio and therefore
    the same by-construction argument below.  ``pairing_edge_nq`` therefore may
    not drop BELOW ``PAIRING_PANEL_NQ`` and ``__post_init__`` rejects a value
    that does: it is what makes "the grid branch is never worse than the exact
    branch it approximates" (tests/test_pairing_edge_fix.py) hold BY
    CONSTRUCTION for the samples that take this rule -- a strictly finer rule on
    an identical panel split -- rather than by calibration; at 8 nodes per panel
    it degrades to 6.2e-1 nats.  (For the TRUSTED samples, which take
    ``jnp.interp`` of log I and are constrained by no node count, that invariant
    holds by MEASUREMENT only: the smallest margin over that test's corners is
    1.45x, at m_min = 2, dm_min = 10, beta = 0 with N_grid = 2048, against 199x
    at the other end.)  Raising it costs ``2 * pairing_edge_nq``
    ``_eval_unnorm`` evaluations per sample (against ``2 * PAIRING_PANEL_NQ`` for
    the exact branch).  Lowering ``pairing_edge_tol`` routes more samples onto
    that rule, which since the panel split is no longer a trade: measured at
    beta = -2 with a narrow taper over the bulk of the support, the rule alone is
    1.8e-6 nats against 3.2e-4 for the interpolant (whose residual there is not
    interpolation at all but the 16-node panel rule its grid nodes are built on --
    the two agree to every printed digit).  It used to be the other way round
    (0.19 nats for the single-panel rule against 2e-5 for the interpolant); that
    warning belonged to the pre-2026-09-05 rule and no longer applies.

    ``pairing_m_hi`` is the UPPER bound of that opt-in pairing m1 grid.  It is a
    SEPARATE knob from the mass-grid ceiling ``m_hi`` precisely so that sizing
    the pairing grid to a mass model whose primary-mass support extends past
    ``m_hi`` (e.g. ``gwtc5_fiducial_bpl2peaks`` with a fixed high-mass edge at
    300 Msun) never perturbs the mass-normalisation grid of any other model.
    ``jnp.interp`` clamps queries outside the grid ends, so a ceiling BELOW a
    model's support would silently bias the pairing normaliser inside the
    support; :func:`size_pairing_grid_to_support` /
    :func:`assert_pairing_grid_covers_support` keep it truthful.

    """Gauss-Legendre nodes/weights on (0, 1) for ONE pairing normaliser panel.

    ``PairingModel.__call__`` integrates ``N(m1) = int p(q|m1) dq`` over the
    support ``(q_cut, 1]`` as TWO panels split at the taper shoulder
    ``q_a = m_shoulder/m1``: the integrand is a Planck-taper boundary layer below
    ``q_a`` and the bare (analytic) pairing kernel above it, so a single smooth
    rule has to resolve a corner that neither side actually has.  Splitting there
    gives Gauss-Legendre two analytic pieces and lets a per-sample rule of a few
    dozen nodes beat the 200-node uniform trapezoid this replaced by four orders
    of magnitude on the H0-CORRELATED part of the residual, which is the
    statistic the cosmology actually sees (measured; see
    ``PairingModel._panel_nodes`` and the module note on ``pairing_edge_tol``).

    THOSE NUMBERS ARE FOR A ``q**beta`` KERNEL -- the pairing both production
    models use, and what the panel above the shoulder is analytic in.  A kernel
    with a feature narrower than a panel is not resolved by any fixed-node
    rule and must declare that feature's edges through
    ``PairingModel._panel_edges`` (``GaussianPairing`` does); the node count
    itself stays a constant.

    BEING ANALYTIC THERE, THAT PANEL IS NO LONGER QUADRATURED AT ALL for the two
    production models: ``PairingModel._plateau_integral`` returns
    ``(1 - q_a**(beta+1))/(beta+1)`` exactly, so these nodes are spent only on
    the taper boundary layer.  That is not just cheaper, it closes a hole: at
    steep negative ``beta`` the plateau integrand is a boundary layer at ``q_a``
    itself, which shrinks like 1/m1, so GL-16's residual there GROWS with m1 and
    is coherent across the mass population.  Measured on the 259-event dark-siren
    likelihood at (beta_q, m2_low, delta_m2) = (-1.9, 3.05, 1.15), the
    Gauss-Legendre plateau tilted logL by 0.93 nats peak-to-peak across the H0
    prior [20, 140] (slope -1.04 nats) against 2.0e-4 (slope -2.8e-5) with the
    closed form.

    32 IS A MEASURED FLOOR, NOT A DEFAULT TO TUNE, AND 16 WAS BELOW IT.  What
    sets the node count is the taper panel, whose boundary layer narrows as m1
    approaches ``m_min``: below the shoulder the whole q-support sits inside the
    Planck taper, the plateau panel has zero width, and the residual left there
    is coherent across the mass population -- so it tilts logL with H0 rather
    than averaging out.  Measured end to end on the 259-event dark-siren
    likelihood against a GL-256-per-panel reference, peak-to-peak over H0 in
    [20, 140] with every other label pinned (nats)::

        coordinate (beta_q, m2_low, delta_m2)        GL-16     GL-32
        (-1.95, 3.05, 9.50), worst of 13 corners   6.98e-02  5.16e-06
        (-1.95, 3.05, 8.00), worst of a 25-pt map  1.16e-01  8.50e-06
        registered fiducial                        1.09e-03  3.17e-07

    At 16 the worst corner is 1.4x OVER the campaign's 0.05-nat H0-tilt budget
    and four of those 25 map points exceed it -- low ``m2_low``, wide taper,
    steep negative ``beta_q``, a band inside the shipped prior rather than a
    needle.  At 32 nothing on either map, or on the spectral configuration,
    exceeds 1e-05.  The cost, measured on an H100 NVL as three interleaved
    launches per arm on the final tree, is 16 -> 32 = +1.05 ms per likelihood
    call on the 259-event dark-siren configuration (10.869 -> 11.920 ms,
    1.097x, peak device memory unchanged at 9.923 GiB) and +0.92 ms on the
    259-event spectral one (2.594 -> 3.517 ms, 1.356x, peak 0.644 -> 0.772
    GiB).  Spectral pays the larger FRACTION because that call has no catalog
    term for the pairing work to hide behind.  GL-48 (3.4e-09) and a 4x GL-16
    composite (64 nodes, 8.3e-07) buy accuracy nobody needs for roughly another
    1.6 ms.  A maintainer lowering this constant must re-run that scan;
    tests/test_pairing_panel_quadrature.py::test_worst_case_bound_over_the_full_prior_box
    fails at 16.

    The node set is static -- it depends on no setting -- so the quadrature is a
    compile-time constant and a proposal never retraces on it.

    (``PairingModel._panel_norm``), only at ``pairing_edge_nq`` nodes per panel
    instead of ``PAIRING_PANEL_NQ`` (``NormalizationGridSettings.__post_init__``

    The integrand below the shoulder is the taper boundary layer
    ``S(m_min + t (m1 - m_min))``, of width ``A^-1 = (m1 - m_min)/dm_min`` in

    nodes where a uniform rule needs ~``A`` of them, which is what makes a

    against 1.4 for 16 uniform-trapezoid nodes).  The nodes are open, so the

    derivatives are singular -- is never evaluated.
