Abstract base classes and the MixtureModel / PopulationModel assemblers.

Mixture weight parameterisation — stick-breaking
-------------------------------------------------
A k-component mixture has k-1 free weight parameters v_1 ... v_{k-1},
each sampled from U[0, 1].  The final k weights are produced by
stick-breaking:

    w_1     = v_1
    w_i     = v_i * prod_{j < i}(1 − v_j)    for i = 2 … k−1
    w_k     = prod_{j=1}^{k-1}(1 − v_j)

All v_i ∈ [0, 1]  →  all w_i ∈ [0, 1]  and  Σ w_i = 1, by construction.
Negative weights are impossible regardless of the sampled values.

Why this replaces the old "last weight = 1 − Σ" approach
---------------------------------------------------------
Under the old parameterisation every v_i was sampled independently from
U[0, 1] and the last weight was computed as w_k = 1 − Σ_{i<k} v_i.
The fraction of the U[0,1]^{k-1} prior volume where w_k ≥ 0 is 1/(k−1)!:

    k=2 → 100 %   k=3 → 50 %   k=4 → 17 %   k=5 → 4 %

For five-component models the sampler spent 96 % of proposals in a region
that is silently mapped to −∞, collapsing effective sample sizes and
biasing evidence estimates.

Prior bounds on the weight parameters stay [0, 1], as do the CLI flags and
sampler configuration.  The PRIOR FAMILY on them is Beta(1, k-i) for v_i, which
is what makes the induced weight prior the uniform Dirichlet(1, ..., 1) the old
"last weight = 1 - Σ" parameterisation had (uniform on the box conditioned on the
simplex IS uniform on the simplex).  Sampling every v_i from U[0, 1] instead —
as this file did until the stick prior was declared — gives
E[w] = (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...): informative, and dependent on the ORDER the
components appear in the model name.  k = 2 is unaffected (Beta(1, 1) = U[0, 1]).

Labels: weight parameters are now named $v_i$ (stick-breaking inputs),
not $f_i$ (direct fractions).  If you use ``fixed_parameter_values`` in
a settings JSON and previously wrote ``"$f_1$": 0.3``, rename the key to
``"$v_1$"`` and convert the value: for k=2 the number is unchanged; for
k≥3 use v_i = w_i / (1 − w_1 − … − w_{i−1}).

Sentinel convention
-------------------
p ≤ 0  →  log p = −jnp.inf.

The old code used −1e10.  That value is finite, so it propagated through
logsumexp / jnp.sum and appeared as a valid (very negative) likelihood to
the sampler.  Using −∞ everywhere is correct: logsumexp and jnp.sum
handle −∞ entries properly, and the final jnp.isfinite guard in the
likelihood rejects any proposal that produces −∞.

        The q-support is ``(q_cut, 1]`` with ``q_cut = m_edge/m1``: it depends on
        a SAMPLED parameter and on the query m1.  Nodes are therefore placed
        RELATIVE to the support, ``q = q_cut + t w``, so they follow the edge
        instead of being crossed by it -- the same trick
        ``GWTC5FiducialBPL2PeaksMass._taper_window_grid`` uses for the mass taper.

        With the historical FIXED grid the normaliser
        ``N(m1) = int p(q|m1) dq`` was a staircase in both ``m1`` and ``m_min``
        (it only changed when ``q_cut`` crossed a node): measured on
        ``PowerLawPairing`` at m_min = 5, dm_min = 0.01, q = 0.9,
        ``p(q|m1)`` was bit-identical over m1 in [60, 62] while the true N grows
        3%, and ``d log p/d m_min`` was 0 almost everywhere with spurious +1.37
        spikes wherever a node happened to land inside the taper window (against a
        true value of ~0.03).  Support-relative nodes also spend every node inside
        the support, so the edge itself is resolved for any m1.

        The support is then SPLIT at ``q_a = m_shoulder/m1`` (clipped into
        ``[q_cut, 1]``).  ``p(q|m1)`` is a Planck taper rising from an exactly-zero
        edge on ``[q_cut, q_a]``, and the bare pairing kernel -- ``q**beta`` for
        both production models, the taper being identically 1.0 there
        (``utils.sfilter_low`` returns a literal one at and above the shoulder) --
        on ``[q_a, 1]``.  The joint integrand has a corner at ``q_a`` that neither
        piece has, and a corner is exactly what a single smooth rule cannot
        resolve.

        What the split buys is NOT mainly a smaller worst case -- 16 nodes per
        panel (the count shipped until 2026-09-06; it is now
        ``PAIRING_PANEL_NQ`` = 32) are 7.6e-3 nats off near the support edge
        against the 200-node
        uniform trapezoid's 3.1e-2 (50 prior draws, composite-GL reference), only
        4x -- but a far smaller COHERENT error.  The trapezoid's residual is a
        one-sided endpoint deficit that does not self-average over the m1
        population, so it tilts with H0 (m1src = m1det/(1+z(H0)) rescales the
        whole population): measured over 259 events, the H0-correlated part of
        the residual is 7.4e-3 .. 1.6e-1 nats for the trapezoid and
        1.4e-4 .. 9.6e-4 nats for this rule, and on the real 259-event dark-siren
        likelihood the trapezoid carries a -0.10-nat monotone slope across the
        H0 prior [20, 140] where this rule carries +1.2e-3.  Amplitude is the
        wrong statistic here; coherence is.

        Either panel may collapse to zero width -- ``dm_min = 0`` kills panel A,
        ``m_shoulder >= m1`` kills panel B, ``m_edge >= m1`` kills both -- and a
        zero-width panel contributes exactly 0.0 to the sum (a finite integrand
        times a zero width), so no branch is needed for them.

        A subclass whose kernel carries a feature narrower than a panel declares
        that feature's edges through :meth:`_panel_edges` and gets one panel per
        extra edge; the two-panel split above is what every model without such a
        feature -- both production pairings -- takes, unchanged.

        A subclass that knows the CLOSED FORM of the topmost panel's integral
        declares it through :meth:`_plateau_integral`, and that panel then costs
        no nodes at all.  Both production pairings do; it is where half the
        nodes and two thirds of the transcendentals of this rule went.

        build nodes for a panel the closed form has taken over, so it walks
        :meth:`_panel_boundaries` and :meth:`_panel_from_edges` itself.  This
        method is the executable description of the rule -- what the tests
        exercise, and what a reader should read first -- but overriding it

        r"""CLOSED FORM for the topmost panel ``[q_lo, 1]``, or ``None``.

        Above the taper shoulder the low-mass filter is identically 1.0
        (``utils.sfilter_low`` returns a literal one there), so on the last panel
        the integrand is the BARE pairing kernel -- for both production models a
        plain ``q**beta``, whose integral is one line of algebra.  A subclass
        that knows that closed form returns ``(integral, sup)``:

        * ``integral`` = ``int_{q_lo}^{1} p_unnorm(q | m1) dq`` exactly, and
        * ``sup`` = an upper bound on ``p_unnorm`` over ``[q_lo, 1]``, which
          replaces the panel's node maximum in the scale factoring of
          :meth:`_panel_norm` (there are no nodes left to take a maximum over).
          It MUST be 0.0 wherever the panel has zero width, or a row whose whole
          integrand is ~exp(-500)-tiny in the taper toe would be rescaled by an
          O(1) bound and lose exactly the underflow protection the factoring
          exists for.

        Returning ``None`` -- the default -- keeps the Gauss-Legendre panel, so a
        pairing without an analytic plateau (``GaussianPairing``) and any
        out-of-tree subclass are unaffected.  The hook is handed the last panel's
        lower edge rather than the shoulder itself, so it stays correct for a
        subclass that declares extra edges through :meth:`_panel_edges` above the
        shoulder: those are sorted into the edge list, so ``q_lo >= q_a`` always
        and the kernel is bare over the whole panel either way.  No shipped class
        declares both hooks, so nothing in this tree exercises that composition:
        an out-of-tree subclass that declares both must pin it itself.

        Worth doing because the plateau panel is half the per-sample quadrature
        and the more expensive half: a node there costs a ``log`` and two ``exp``
        (``q**beta`` is ``exp(beta log q)``, the Planck taper another ``exp``)
        against ONE ``exp`` for the whole closed form.  Measured on an H100 NVL,
        float64, three interleaved launches per arm, 20 timed calls each,
        replacing this panel removes 0.69 ms of a 3.57 ms 259-event spectral
        likelihood call (1.24x, and 0.776 -> 0.640 GiB of peak device memory) and
        0.90 ms of a 47.49 ms 259-event dark-siren call (1.02x).

        It is not only cheaper.  At steep negative ``beta`` the plateau integrand
        is itself a boundary layer at ``q_lo = m_shoulder/m1``, which shrinks like
        1/m1, so Gauss-Legendre's residual there GROWS with m1 and is coherent
        across the mass population -- exactly the shape that tilts with H0, since
        ``m1src = m1det/(1+z(H0))`` rescales the whole population.  Measured on
        the 259-event dark-siren likelihood at
        ``(beta_q, m2_low, delta_m2) = (-1.9, 3.05, 1.15)``, inside the shipped
        prior: 0.93 nats peak-to-peak across H0 in [20, 140] with a -1.04-nat
        slope for the GL panel, against 2.0e-4 nats and -2.8e-5 for this.
