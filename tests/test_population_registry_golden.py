"""Golden regression test for the population-model registry refactor.

The golden file ``tests/data/population_registry_golden.json`` was generated
from the PRE-refactor registry (hardcoded factories).  For every legacy model
name it pins:

    * prior lower/upper bounds,
    * the fiducial parameter vector from ``get_fixed_population_params``,
    * ``log_p_pop`` evaluated at the fiducial on a fixed probe grid.

Parameter LaTeX labels are stored for reference (used to write the migration
note) but are deliberately NOT compared: the refactor is an approved clean
break on labels.  Physics — bounds, fiducials, numerics — must match exactly.

Regenerate (only against code known to be physics-correct) with:
