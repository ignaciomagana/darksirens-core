"""The N_obs(N_obs+3)/(2 N_eff) Monte-Carlo correction in selection.py.

This coefficient looks like a typo and has been "corrected" to
N_obs(N_obs+1)/(2 N_eff) by readers before. It is not a typo: the two forms
are two different PRIOR CONVENTIONS on the selection integral mu, and
N_obs(N_obs+3) is the one Farr (2019) eq. 11 states and the one the reference
implementation (``gwpopulation.vt.ResamplingVT.vt_factor``) uses.

Marginalising the rate with the scale-free prior p(R) ∝ 1/R leaves
L ∝ mu^{-N}; Monte-Carlo error makes mu uncertain, mu ~ N(mu_hat, sigma^2)
with sigma = mu_hat/sqrt(N_eff). Then

    flat prior on mu      ->  <mu^-N>/mu_hat^-N = 1 + N(N+1)/(2 N_eff)
    Jeffreys p(mu) ∝ 1/mu ->  <mu^-N>/mu_hat^-N = 1 + N(N+3)/(2 N_eff)

Both branches are integrated numerically below so the distinction is
demonstrated, not asserted. A reviewer who integrates only the flat branch
measures N(N+1) and concludes the code is wrong; these tests exist to make
that dead end obvious.
